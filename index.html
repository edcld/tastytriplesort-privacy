<p>
The Game does not collect personal information from any users, including children under 13 years of age. The Game is suitable for all ages and contains no inappropriate content. Ads shown are managed by Google AdMob, which may limit ad targeting for child-directed content.
</p>
<h2>3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES</h2>

The Game uses Google AdMob to display banner ads and optional rewarded video ads (e.g., to earn extra lives). AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data for ad serving and measurement purposes.
