Tasty Triple Sort ("the Game") is developed as a casual puzzle game. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

2. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY

The Game does not collect personal information from any users, including children under 13 years of age. The Game is suitable for all ages and contains no inappropriate content. Ads shown are managed by Google AdMob, which may limit ad targeting for child-directed content.

3. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES

The Game uses Google AdMob to display banner ads and optional rewarded video ads (e.g., to earn extra lives).

No other third-party analytics or social media services are integrated.
